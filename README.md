# MySQL-Tableau-Data-Analysis-Viz
1. I analyzed an employee dataset downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhj4axkaupjhmbq/employees_mod.sql?dl=0 using MySQL
2. I followed the steps provided in the course https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-mysql-for-data-analytics-and-business-intelligence/ to link MySQL files to Tableau and visualize
3. To query the dataset for specific values, SQL functions like WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY, AGGREGATE FUNCTION, STORED PROCEDURES, JOINS were used
4. The queried data was imported to Tableau and a dashboard was created.
5. Here's my blog explaining the project: https://abhinav14rd.wordpress.com/2023/11/07/from-sql-queries-to-tableau-visualizations/
